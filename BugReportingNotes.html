stay up-to-date with security fixes
avoid duplicating reports: i.e -visit most frequently reported bugs.

Here, we will cover alot of questions regarding Tools of the Trade.
Searching for vulnerabilities inside working applications is how we turn value and control into weaponized information.
Digital-Forensic, Exploit-Dev, Techinical Writing, Bug-Reporting are covered here.

Bug Reporting^1 2016/11

Bug reporting is an Art: Artistian Global =
-N offer simple details, non-technical discussion
-S offer extensive prompt, logs,shells,file - moderate details
-A offer advanced report, developer level details
-E offer expert details, policy,procedures,leadership 

N most users of N are novice bug reporters. Expect duplicates for first reports and small details.
S standard users are command proficient users sophisticated enough, should be seuser=Default_reporter_u
A advanced users know the developer workflow and are sysadmin experienced in bug hunting. the bar is set here!
E expert users need no explaination

Why Report Bugs?^2 2017/1

for 6 reasons:
-preparation
Preparations: - Planning your end goal. Identify your core responsibility. Identify your test case and use case

-identification
Identification: - Observe the signs of an incedent. Take first steps [incident responce]. Detect insider threats [threads]

-containment
Containment: - Documentation; logs, domains, urls, filetypes. Identify trust model[outside vendors?]

-eradication
Eradication: - Is backup compromised? Migrating Architectures

-recovery
Recovery: - System monitoring. Expect an increase in attacks. Determine who determins what is: Safe-to-do, return to productivity.

-special actions
Special Actions: Report type of incident. Record-keeping. Pre-built forms. Legal actions. Follow-up
